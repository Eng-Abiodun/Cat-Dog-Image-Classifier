# Image-Classifier
This model was built using Tensorflow Keras

I built a model to classify an image as a Dog or Cat

The data folder contains folders of Cat and Dog seperately with each having images in Train, Test and Validation folder

The jpg images can be used to test the model and you can get other images online to test the model

The 'cat_dog_3.h5' is the saved model

NOTE: This is my first model built and my first upload on Github, the accuracy of the prediction might not be high but I am happy this is a milestone!
