# Image-Classifier
I built a model to classify an image as a Dog or Cat |
The data folder contains folders of Cat and Dog seperately with each having images in Train, Test and Validation folder |
the jpg images can be used to test the model and you can get other images online to test the model |
the 'cat_dog_3.h5' is the saved model |

NOTE: This is my first model built and my first upload on Github, the accuracy of the prediction might not be high but I am happy this is a milestone!
